# Docker Busybox

A tiny custom Busybox build with limited functionality. 

`adduser` and `addgroup` for user management.

`ln` for creating necessary symlinks of shared object libraries.

`grep`, `nc` and `wget` for running container health checks.

`ls` for poking around inside the image.

Built in `echo` and `test` hush shell commands.
